FSLSTM: Federated Stacked LSTM for Anomaly Detection in Smart Buildings

This software implements the federated learning framework described in:

"A Federated Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Smart Buildings"
Published in ACM Transactions on Internet of Things, 2021

The FSLSTM framework enables privacy-preserving collaborative learning across
IoT sensors in smart buildings for anomaly detection while maintaining data
locality and security through federated learning principles.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

This software implements federated learning with privacy-preserving mechanisms.
However, users should be aware that:

1. While the framework is designed to keep data local, proper implementation
   and configuration are required to ensure privacy guarantees.

2. The security of the federated learning process depends on proper deployment
   of secure aggregation and communication protocols.

3. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable privacy
   regulations and data protection laws in their jurisdiction.

4. The software provides privacy-by-design features but does not guarantee
   absolute privacy or security without proper implementation and deployment.
